Salesforce user,

The Salesforce Staging environment for your testing will be unavailable tonight starting at 5:30 pm Central and lasting through the weekend.  We will send a notification when it is available again.

NOTE:  This does not affect the production instance of Salesforce - only the testing environment!

Thank you,
Salesforce Team
