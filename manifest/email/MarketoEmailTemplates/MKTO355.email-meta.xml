    <textOnly>The power of virtual primary care
Good health starts with quality primary care, but according to Teladoc Health data, most people (four out of five adults) don’t have a dedicated primary care physician. Virtual primary care has the power to give more people more options to connect with primary care providers.
After looking at data from a sample of 3,000+ virtual primary care members, we saw the program positively changing the care experience by:
• Increasing access to primary (and other) care
• Enhancing member interactions with their care team
• Driving improved clinical outcomes
Get all the results and explore real member experiences in the Teladoc Health Virtual Primary Care white paper today.
