A recent study in collaboration with The Academy revealed that there&apos;s a relatively large gap between where leading health systems stand today with virtual care delivery, and where they want to be. But what&apos;s keeping them behind the curve? After reviewing the data and identifying opportunities for change, four clear imperatives emerged as the necessary next steps for health systems:

Digital health strategy exists in name only—and that must change.

Secure operational buy-in from the start.
Scale is a catch-22. Proceed with caution.

Get more details on these insights and how to move forward with your own organization by reading the full study.
