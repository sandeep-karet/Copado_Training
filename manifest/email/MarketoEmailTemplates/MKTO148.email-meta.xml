    <textOnly>Do your clients know how much chronic conditions can cost them?
More than 147 million Americans live with at least one chronic condition—many with more than one condition—representing 90% of U.S. healthcare spend. Providing effective, convenient options for members to manage their chronic conditions represents a significant health benefit, as well as a cost‑saving opportunity.
Not all chronic care solutions can adequately address the complex needs of members. Teladoc Health now offers chronic care management solutions, built to complement and support health plan costs by managing multiple chronic conditions for members and containing claim costs for the employer.
