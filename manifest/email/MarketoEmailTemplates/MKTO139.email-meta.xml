Virtual care is now a common offering in benefits packages; however, these solutions may not be addressing every member’s needs. The traditional acute care model does not fit the 24/7/365 needs of people living with chronic conditions.
Our three new chronic care management solutions eliminate the cost of managing multiple point solutions for you and your members. Easy‑to‑use online tools and services for diabetes, prediabetes and cardiovascular condition management create personalized, actionable and timely support.
