Thank you for your interest in Teladoc Health. I wanted to follow-up to my earlier voicemail to introduce myself and further assist with describing how Teladoc Health (TDH) is transforming how people access healthcare around the world.

Teladoc Health offers the only comprehensive virtual care solution capable of serving organizations and individuals anywhere and at any time. Our services span the spectrum of healthcare needs, from simple to the most complex.

Would there be an opportunity to further discuss how Teladoc Health could be impactful to your virtual healthcare strategy? Book some time on my calendar and I would love to have a quick conversation: https://calendly.com/krisfloyd/15-minute-teladoc-chat
