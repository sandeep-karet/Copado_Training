    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Client}},

I wanted to personally reach out and thank you for the time you took to share your feedback in the recent Teladoc Health survey. Your candid responses help us enhance our solutions to make it even easier to create better results together. I want to assure you our cross-functional client experience team has conducted an in-depth analysis of your feedback to ensure our plans are aligned with your priorities, including improving on operational efficiencies and enhancing quality partnerships. We are committed to investing in innovations to meet your needs and deliver on a whole-person care experience you and your members can depend on.

I am also excited to share, due to the significant number of responses to our survey, we were able to donate to the following charities: American Red Cross, World Telehealth Initiative, American Heart Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF). Thank you once again for your valuable time, honest feedback, and thoughtful suggestions. Together, we can make better health possible.
Sincerely,
Kristen Moody
