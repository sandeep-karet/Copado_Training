Please note this is for membership and consult fee payments only. Claims remitted via payors will go to a separate company as they do today. We will be reaching out to those payors directly.

Our preference is that all payments going forward are transacted electronically. To receive our J.P. Morgan ACH/Wire banking details, please contact the Teladoc Billing Support team at clientremitsupport@teladochealth.com &lt;[[mailto:clientremitsupport@teladochealth.com]]&gt; or call 888-260-4425 Monday to Friday, 8am – 5pm CST. Please have your reference number available to assist us in providing the correct banking information. 

Please continue to send remittance information to payments@teladochealth.com &lt;[[mailto:payments@teladochealth.com]]&gt;. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance with this transition.
