Integrated chronic condition programs improve more than just health outcomes
In a recent study of more than 24,000 Teladoc Health members with multiple chronic conditions, the data consistently shows that integrated chronic care management programs result in better clinical outcomes, lower costs and a better member experience. Insights include:
- Members enrolled in multiple programs engage more and see greater improvement. 	- For members with uncontrolled chronic conditions, our program delivers meaningful results immediately and sustains these results over time.
“The results of this large-scale study clearly demonstrate the power and value of whole-person care. When people have access to a single, high-quality source of support for their chronic physical and mental health needs, they achieve better results across the board.”
