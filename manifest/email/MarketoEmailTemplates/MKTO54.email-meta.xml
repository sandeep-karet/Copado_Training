    <subject>Neurology-Stroke Customer Transition to Solo &amp; Smart Notes</subject>
    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Hello}}, 

 At Teladoc Health, we believe it is important that we continue to improve and enhance our offerings to create the world&apos;s best virtual care platform. To create consistency and provide all our clients with access to the best and latest features, we will be working directly with you on transitioning to the new neurology-stroke solution, Smart Notes, on our Solo platform. Together Solo and Smart Notes provide an improved user experience, more seamless integration with patient consultation (Provider Access Software), workflow and documentation templates built specifically for neurology and stroke use cases, an improved consultation note format, and enhanced data analytics capabilities. 

 We&apos;re here to help make this a smooth transition and we&apos;ll make sure you are ready to go live on the new solution successfully. It is extremely important to note that these improvements are designed to support existing clinical and operational workflows and we anticipate minimal impact for your program, including no charge for the transition effort. A dedicated Teladoc Health resource will be assigned to manage this effort with you to ensure an efficient and effective transition. Please click here &lt;[[https://go1.teladochealth.com/rs/138-DRH-707/images/Solo_Smart_Notes_Migration_FAQ.pdf]]&gt; to download an FAQ document to address common questions you may have.

You will be contacted by your Client Executive/AVP on the target start date of your transition effort.

Thank you for being our partner and allowing us to continue 
to serve you and especially, thank you for all you do. 

Sincerely, 
 Teladoc Health Product Team</textOnly>
