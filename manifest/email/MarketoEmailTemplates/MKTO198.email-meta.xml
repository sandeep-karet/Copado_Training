Labor’s partner in health

Livongo is now part of Teladoc Health, the global leader in virtual care. &lt;[[http://go.teladochealth.com/livongo/]]&gt;

This year’s Forum successfully brought together leaders in the industry to discuss many urgent topics in healthcare, including consumer expectations, health equity, mental health and chronic condition management. One panel in particular explored the opportunity for organizations to shift from managing a collection of health management programs to a single, integrated solution that addresses multiple chronic conditions, including mental health. We know this is a large challenge for fund administrators and a focus for us as we develop our products and services. We also understand that utilization is important to the success of our programs, which is why Teladoc Health also provides a robust Engagement Center &lt;[[https://engagementcenter.com/Search?ShopBy=415&amp;src=homepage_openenrollmentresources]]&gt;, featuring a number of customizable communication materials proven to help drive adoption and engagement of our programs within the workforce.

Read on to learn more about how our condition management programs and our proven engagement strategies work together to help members living with chronic conditions lead healthier lives.

Everyone at Teladoc Health is proud to provide working men and women with products and services that fit their lives and wishes you all a Happy Labor Day!

As always, thank you for being a great partner.

IN THE NEWS
 
When it comes to diabetes, no two paths are the same because no two individuals are the same
Dr. Vidya Raman-Tangella explains how some diabetes management programs misleadingly tout their ability to “reverse” diabetes, even though major scientific organizations agree that only “remission,” not “reversal,” is possible. Learn what actually works &lt;[[https://www.statnews.com/sponsor/2022/07/05/when-it-comes-to-diabetes-no-two-paths-are-the-same-because-no-two-individuals-are-the-same/]]&gt;

CUSTOMER IN THE SPOTLIGHT
 
UFCW Local 338 is expanding the Teladoc Health virtual care programs for its 5,600 primary members and dependents as of October 1, 2022. The expanded virtual care solution will provide members access to a comprehensive mental health solution, myStrength Complete. And while the existing diabetes management program supports those with additional comorbidities, UFCW Local 338 members will now have access to all chronic condition programs, such as the hypertension and prediabetes programs.

Also, an Expert Medical Services program with a clinically intense Expert Medical Opinion support service was added to ensure members have the proper diagnosis and treatment program. The entire virtual care program will be financed on a per-utilizer, per-visit, or per-case basis. UFCW Local 338 will only pay for what its members utilize, i.e., there are no PEPMs.

Earl Mathurin, UFCW Local 338’s Fund Administrator, commented, “The Board of Trustees is very proud to bring the best of virtual care to our members. With the clinical tools and resources available through Teladoc Health, we expect improved health outcomes for our members and savings for the Fund that will far outweigh the cost. We appreciate Teladoc Health working with us as a true strategic partner in delivering the very best in virtual care to our members.”

THE MEMBER EXPERIENCE

“My overall experience with [the Diabetes Management program] has been nothing short of phenomenal. I don’t want to take medications to have low blood sugars—I want to be able to do it on my own.”
