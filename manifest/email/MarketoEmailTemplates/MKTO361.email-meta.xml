    <subject>A clinician’s perspective on integrated virtual care</subject>
    <textOnly>Augment current care, empower self-management
A whole-person approach to virtual care goes beyond convenience. It empowers and encourages members to take control of their health, while providing clinicians a fuller picture of their needs through integrated data collection. Working together, digital health and in-person interactions can create more efficient, and effective, care delivery.
 
“If we connect virtual and in-person services—using self-managed, provider-managed and even community-based interactions—in a thoughtful and strategic way, that’s when we create value.&quot; Jedrek Wosik, MD, Director of Clinical Product, Teladoc Health
Hear more from our interview with Dr. Wosik as he discusses how leading virtual care solutions are bringing both digital health and clinical care closer together for the benefit of clinicians and the people they serve.
