    <subject>Your Voice Matters: Participate in the Teladoc Health Annual Client Survey on September 12</subject>
    <textOnly>Our annual client survey is just around the corner, and your feedback plays a crucial role in our ongoing commitment to making better health possible for all.


On September 12th, you will receive another email from me, inviting you to participate in our brief, 5-minute survey. Your insights are invaluable to us, and I encourage you to take a moment to share your thoughts. Your input will help us drive positive change and ensure that Teladoc Health continues to meet your and your patients’ needs effectively.
Participation in last year&apos;s survey made a significant impact, leading to accomplishments that have benefited members, clients, and partners. Here are some highlights of what we achieved so far based on last year’s survey feedback:
-  Deepened Client Relationships: We prioritized strengthening our partnerships and enhancing engagement opportunities. Our Forum, which gathered over 150 organizations worldwide, fostered meaningful conversations through 30+ sessions, client awards, and various engagement platforms like advisory councils and executive sponsorships.
- Clinical Innovation and Workflow Transformation: The launch of our Inpatient Connected Care solution enabling virtual nursing to help address workforce challenges.
- 
Improved Industry Insights: We refocused our communication strategy to provide more access to education and innovative insights through industry-relevant panels, workshops, and webinar opportunities.







	- Operational Excellence: Guided by your feedback, we made significant headway in simplifying pricing structures, amplifying billing efficiency, and augmenting analytical resources for a broader client audience. The forthcoming launch of Fleet Access Manager promises to assist clients in self-administration.
Together, we are shaping a future where healthcare is more accessible, efficient, and patient-centered. I look forward to your participation and feedback in the upcoming survey.



Best regards,
