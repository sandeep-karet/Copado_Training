    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

Thank you so much for attending my roundtable at the Becker’s Annual Meeting. We talked about the change management considerations some health systems have faced while building hybrid care models, and I hope the discussion provided valuable insight into overcoming these obstacles and provided strategies for you to take back to your organization.

If you have any questions about how our virtual care solutions may help your organization, don’t hesitate to reach out directly to me or to your sales team at Teladoc Health.

Thanks,

Tony Burke
SVP, Partnerships and Innovation, Hospital and Health Systems
