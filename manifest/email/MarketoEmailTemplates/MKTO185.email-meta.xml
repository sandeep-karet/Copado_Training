    <textOnly>Our proven results will help you cut your clients’ costs
The most effective benefits packages are ones members actually use. Members who use our chronic care management solutions to manage one or more of their chronic conditions give us more than a 64 average Net Promoter Score (NPS) on their experience. That’s well above the NPS for many other health plans.
However, what we really care about are the health benefits and cost savings our solutions provide you and your members.
