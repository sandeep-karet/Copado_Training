“Mental health is a universal human right”
Join us on October 10 as we recognize World Mental Health Day. Teladoc Health believes accessible, trustworthy mental health support is critical to one’s overall health. That’s why we decided to rethink mental healthcare delivery: to offer virtual care solutions that not only reduce barriers to care but offer a wide range of support and a positive care experience. Check out the Resources section below for items that can support your efforts around World Mental Health Day.

Teladoc Health’s integrated solutions meet individuals where they are, via a unified consumer experience across primary care, chronic care and mental healthcare—delivering care that spans every part of their health journey. But don’t take our word for it. Hear from a Teladoc Health member, Estrella, who explains how Teladoc Health addressed both her mental and physical health, and what that meant to her. &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FSkWhC2WWY]]&gt;
