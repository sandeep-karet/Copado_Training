    <textOnly>JOIN OUR WEBINAR:
Redesigning the Inpatient Experience with Virtual Care Delivery
Wednesday, December 15
1:00 PM Eastern
We’ve invited Jennifer Ball, Director of Virtual Care at Saint Luke’s Health System, to talk about her experience with one of the nation’s first virtual nursing programs and how using both in-person and virtual services can provide a solid solution to today’s healthcare challenges.
While Teladoc Health is synonymous with virtual care, we understand that quality inpatient care remains a priority. Join Jennifer as she sits down with Teladoc Health’s Director of Inpatient Care Solutions, Tammy Cress, to discuss the value of redesigning inpatient care delivery to integrate virtual care and the advantages it has given Saint Luke’s.
