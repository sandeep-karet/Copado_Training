    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Attendee}},


Forum 2023 has come to a close and we’ve been reflecting on all the things that made this year’s event extra special. The energy was palpable, the discussion was amazing and being together with nearly 350 people, from more than 150 organizations, pioneering what’s next in virtual care was incredible. 

Check out our first three session articles summarizing some of the most valuable dialogue caught on stage:
