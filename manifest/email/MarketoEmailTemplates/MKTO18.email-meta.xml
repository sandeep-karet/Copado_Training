    <textOnly>Chronic conditions do not exist in silos
People with chronic conditions tend to have two or three health concerns, on average. These members require an integrated solution to manage all of their chronic health needs in one place, rather than across multiple uncoordinated programs.
Teladoc Health now offers a suite of chronic care management solutions, built to support and manage multiple chronic conditions for members, all while containing costs for them and for your clients.
According to national averages:
- 56% of people living with diabetes also have hypertension 	- 85% experience weight challenges 	- 33% have high cholesterol 	- 21% of people with a chronic condition also live with a mental health challenge
Sources: Data on file for diabetes, hypertension, and behavioral health prevalence (DS-4266); Note: behavioral health prevalence is based on medical claims. The 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that prevalence of behavioral health conditions was 25% for clinical conditions and an additional 35% for sub-clinical conditions. Overweight and dyslipidemia prevalence from Kaiser Family Foundation 2018 and 2017 State Health Facts respectively. Overweight prevalence for people with diabetes from CDC.
