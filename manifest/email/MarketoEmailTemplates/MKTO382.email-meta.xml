    <subject>That’s a wrap for Forum 2023</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Attendee}},




Thank you for joining us and making Forum 2023 a great success! Here are just a few highlights from the two days we spent together:
- Over 80 healthcare innovators took the stage, covering an array of top-of-mind topics, ranging from applications of artificial intelligence in virtual care to addressing workforce burnout to health equity and more.
- Renowned chef, restaurateur, New York Times best-selling author, and philanthropist, Marcus Samuelson, delivered an amazing keynote that captivated us with insights inspired by his culinary path and how it connects to the well-being of the person.
- Together, we assembled hundreds of specially curated “Empower Packs” for the attending children of YMCA Greater Boston Summer Camps, effectively mitigating food insecurities they may have otherwise faced over the weekend.










	- The Care Lounge provided a dynamic space for us to connect and re-connect with friends from across the industry. Here, we had the opportunity to co-create an inspiring mural with Boston-based illustrator Ben Jundanian, visually depicting our collective efforts to foster better health for all.
Thank you once again for your valuable insights and contributions to Forum. We look forward to continuing the conversation about how to harness the power of digital health to enhance care delivery and pioneer new solutions.
