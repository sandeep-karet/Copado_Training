    <textOnly>Virtual primary care core components
A recent Business Group on Health report shows benefit consultants list virtual primary care as a top priority. During our recent Virtual Partner Summit our Senior Director of Virtual Primary Care, Bryce Miller, shared what employers—including the dozens of Fortune 1000 clients are using our Primary360 solution—want from this virtual primary care, including:
• Integration with their existing ecosystems
• Navigation to high-quality, cost-effective, in-network care
• A whole-person approach including mental health and chronic care management
