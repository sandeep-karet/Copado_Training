This year, we have an incredible central gathering space – known as the Care Lounge – where attendees can grab a meal or snack, see demos and talk with our experts, contribute to our digital mural illustrated live by an onsite artist, and pause to recharge. Consider it your home base for networking with longtime friends and making new connections.
