Primary care, and the significant health benefits it brings, deserves a bigger role in the healthcare story. Today, four out of five working-age adults lack a strong relationship with a primary care physician, leading to increased health risks and less follow-through on care recommendations.

With Primary360, we’re flipping the script on primary care access and bringing its altogether life-changing benefits to a much wider population. Virtual care, including virtual primary care, is the new standard in healthcare, with 88% of consumers saying they want to continue using telehealth following its widespread adoption during the pandemic and 64% preferring it for parts of their annual physical.

Take a closer look at how Primary360 &lt;[[https://business.teladochealth.com/resources/white-paper/insights-from-teladoc-health-primary360/?&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=NWSLTR-202307-EMP-BAS-Employer-Client-Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign_id=]]&gt; is reimagining primary care and creating a positive member experience by increasing access to care across a wider spectrum of needs, driving first-time and early diagnosis of chronic conditions and driving improved health outcomes—all while reducing the cost of care for you and the people you serve.

In this issue, you’ll find industry news and updates and new client and member success stories demonstrating the power of whole-person care.
