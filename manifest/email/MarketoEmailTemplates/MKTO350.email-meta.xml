Dear Client,

Due to the recent events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank, we are moving our banking relationship to J.P. Morgan, effective immediately. Please transition payments to our new account with J.P. Morgan before your next billing cycle. If you have already updated your bank details, please disregard this notification. 

The new bank details are available using the password-protected link below. You will receive a second email with your password to access the information. 

InTouch Technologies Inc. Bank Details &lt;[[https://s3.amazonaws.com/communications.teladoc.com/finance/intouch-technologies-details.pdf]]&gt;

Our preference is that all payments going forward are transacted electronically. However, for those who still need to send paper checks, they may continue to be sent to Silicon Valley Bank until lockboxes at J.P. Morgan are available. We will follow up with the updated J.P. Morgan lockbox information when it becomes available. 

If you have any questions, call Teladoc Billing Support at 888-260-4425 (Monday-Friday, 8:00am - 5:00pm CST), or email clientremitsupport@teladochealth.com &lt;[[mailto:clientremitsupport@teladochealth.com]]&gt; and cite the Reference Number provided at the top of this email. 





Please continue to send remittance information to payments@teladochealth.com &lt;[[mailto:payments@teladochealth.com]]&gt;.





Thank you in advance for your assistance with this transition.


Richard J. Napolitano 
Chief Accounting Officer
