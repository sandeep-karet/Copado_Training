    <textOnly>Exploring health coaching
Whitney Mirro
Senior Vice President of Clinical Services
Teladoc Health
Health coaching for chronic condition management is one of the most meaningful ways we’ve found to empower individuals to improve their health outcomes.
As part of a new set of conversations we’re calling Virtual Care Connections, we recently sat down with Whitney Mirro, Senior Vice President of Clinical Services at Teladoc Health, to talk about what health coaching brings to the virtual health care experience. In it, Whitney shares:
- Why she believes health coaching is so important to individual health outcomes and to healthcare delivery. 	- Insights on how Teladoc Health delivers member and client value through health coaching. 	- Real-world results and benefits she’s seen through the power of health coaching.
