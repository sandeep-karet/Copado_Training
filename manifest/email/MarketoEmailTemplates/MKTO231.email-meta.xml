    <textOnly>For every step of the healthcare journey: Our whole-person approach
Everyone knows virtual care is convenient. In fact, 91% of those who have used virtual care would do so again in the future, instead of an in-person visit.1 But our whole-person approach goes beyond convenience with a full spectrum of care—from virtual primary care offerings to mental healthcare services and chronic condition management. All from a single partner. 
“Convenience is quality for our members. When they’re utilizing healthcare that’s integrated, coordinated and efficient, they’re more likely to engage.” Jonas Thom, Vice President, Behavioral Health, CareSource 
Watch this session from Forum 2021 to learn how CareSource takes the time to get their members engaged with a collaborative, whole-person approach to care.
