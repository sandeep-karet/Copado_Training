We wanted to make sure you had access to our recent webinar with Microsoft Canada. In this on-demand event, Patrick McCarthy, Assistant Vice President of Telehealth Services at Northwell Health, shares how his organization is leveraging an integrated virtual care platform to:

Maximize tech investments
Increase access to care anywhere, anytime
Improve communication and coordination for care teams and the clinician experience

Integrating communications across physical and virtual channels gives patients and providers the engagement options and experience they want, and it provides health systems with the security, coordination, information access and control they need.
