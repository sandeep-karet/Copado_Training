“Mental health is a universal human right”
Join us on October 10 as we recognize World Mental Health Day. Teladoc Health believes accessible, trustworthy mental health support is critical to one’s overall health. That’s why we decided to rethink mental healthcare delivery: to offer virtual care solutions that not only reduce barriers to care but offer a wide range of support and a positive care experience. Check out the Resources section below for items that can support your efforts around World Mental Health Day.

Teladoc Health’s integrated solutions meet individuals where they are, via a unified consumer experience across primary care, chronic care and mental healthcare—delivering care that spans every part of their health journey. But don’t take our word for it. Hear from a Teladoc Health member, Estrella, who explains how Teladoc Health addressed both her mental and physical health, and what that meant to her. &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FSkWhC2WWY]]&gt;

HCSC’s virtual primary care program powered by Teladoc Health

As a reminder, in January 2023 Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) expanded its virtual care portfolio by offering virtual primary care to some midsize and large employer groups in Illinois and Texas. The virtual primary care model is designed for employers whose workforce is geographically diverse. The model allows employees to get timely and convenient access to a trusted online care team—all while managing healthcare outcomes and costs.
