    <subject>Your Voice Matters: Participate in the Teladoc Health Annual Client Survey on September 12</subject>
    <textOnly>Our annual client survey is just around the corner, and your feedback plays a crucial role in our ongoing commitment to making better health possible for all.


On September 12th, you will receive another email from me, inviting you to participate in our brief, 5-minute survey. Your insights are invaluable to us, and I encourage you to take a moment to share your thoughts. Your input will help us drive positive change and ensure that Teladoc Health continues to meet your and your members’ needs effectively.
Participation in last year&apos;s survey made a significant impact, leading to accomplishments that have benefited members, clients, and partners. Here are some highlights of what we achieved so far based on last year’s survey feedback:
- Deepened Client Relationships: We prioritized strengthening our partnerships and enhancing engagement opportunities. Our Forum, which gathered over 150 organizations worldwide, fostered meaningful conversations through 30+ sessions, client awards, and various engagement platforms like advisory councils and executive sponsorships.
- Operational Improvements: Your feedback guided us in multiple ongoing projects aimed at streamlining operations. We&apos;ve worked to simplify billing, reporting, and data access, focusing on transparency and consistent quality control to make your experience smoother and more efficient.
- 
Unified Member Experience: We embarked on a journey to continue to enable whole-person care under the Teladoc Health brand. The launch of the Teladoc Health unified experience on January 1st, 2023, marked a significant step in achieving a more connected member experience. As a result, 25.5 million lives have already been migrated, enhancing care coordination and accessibility.







	- Enhanced Consumer Engagement: Our collaboration with clients and a strategic approach to marketing has positioned Teladoc Health as a must-have benefit and resource for mutual members. By acting as a thought leader and partnering closely with clients, we&apos;ve successfully driven engagement and empowered members to take charge of their health.
Together, we are shaping a future where healthcare is more accessible, efficient, and member-centered. I look forward to your participation and feedback in the upcoming survey.



Best regards,
