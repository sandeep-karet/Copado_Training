Partner Essentials


Hello! As a member of Teladoc Health’s Strategic Partnerships team, I help our benefit consultant partners learn about our virtual care offerings. Not only am I excited to be at Teladoc Health, but I&apos;m excited to meet you and to help your clients find the right solutions for their virtual care needs—especially when it comes to achieving
improved outcomes.

I am increasingly hearing that our clients need a whole-person solution that delivers meaningful results. Expectations are high, but Teladoc Health is confident that our services can help meet these challenges to improve healthcare overall. In this issue of Partner Essentials, make sure to check out the webinar recording (in Resources below) where Nicola Merryman talks about healthcare industry trends and how virtual care is helping meet the changing needs.
