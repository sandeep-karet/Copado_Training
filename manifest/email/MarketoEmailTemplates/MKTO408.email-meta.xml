    <textOnly>Our annual client survey launches tomorrow, and your feedback plays a crucial role in our ongoing commitment to making better health possible for all.


On September 12th, you will receive another email from me, inviting you to participate in our brief, 5-minute survey. Your insights are invaluable to us, and I encourage you to take a moment to share your thoughts. Your input will help us drive positive change and ensure that HealthiestYou by Teladoc continues to meet your and your members’ needs effectively.
