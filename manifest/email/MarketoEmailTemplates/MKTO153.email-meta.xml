    <textOnly>WHITE PAPER
As Patient Care Channels Become More Fragmented, Communications &amp; Coordination Can Become Integrated
Consumers’ expectations around how they engage with healthcare means that care must be delivered over a multitude of channels. While this approach offers convenience and higher patient satisfaction, there are a number of challenges health systems face when ensuring high-quality, complete and secure care.
A new white paper explores how integrating communications across physical and virtual channels can give:
- Patients and clinicians the engagement options and experience they want 	- Health systems the security, coordination, information access and control they need
