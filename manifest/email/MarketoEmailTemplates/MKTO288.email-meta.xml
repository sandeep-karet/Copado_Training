Partner Essentials

Achieving better health comes from a broader focus
We know that individuals living with chronic illness thrive when given access to specialized tools that help manage their conditions, but recent research indicates that providing cohesive, whole-person services alongside management programs leads to even better results.

In our chronic condition consumer study &lt;[[https://business.teladochealth.com/resources/report/living-with-chronic-conditions-healthcare-experiences-challenges/?&amp;utm_source=tdh&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=cc-ebook&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=broker-january-partner-essentials&amp;utm_campaign_id=]]&gt;, the results revealed:

Whole-person virtual care provides remote interventions that can improve the healthcare experience and maximize health outcomes
Virtual primary care improves ongoing management and coordination among care teams
Integrated care—including mental health services, primary care and chronic condition management—provides a more engaging and more positive user experience
