Workplaces are different today than five years ago. New generations entering the workforce, social change and the economy continue to shift how we live our lives and take care of our health. We also know employers are fighting an uphill battle in offering competitive and relevant benefits that also eliminate unnecessary costs for their organizations. New research from our 2023 Virtual Care Transformation Index is showing that virtual care is a key part of a successful
benefits strategy.

In this issue you’ll find industry news, updates and member success stories demonstrating the power of
virtual care.

Thank you for being a great partner as we continue to learn and improve our solutions in the name of better health.
