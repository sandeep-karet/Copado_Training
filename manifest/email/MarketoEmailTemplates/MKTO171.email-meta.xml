Making health equity the rule, not the exception
At Teladoc Health we are committed to promoting health equity in every aspect of our organization: from the people we hire, to the programs and services we design, to the investments we make to improve clinical quality and healthcare access. All our products are developed to meet individuals where they are. More than half of our chronic care solutions active users live in vulnerable or underserved communities, which is why we provide support for phone-based preferences, low-bandwidth circumstances, mobility issues and over 240 languages.1
Learn about our commitment to health equity and how that might benefit those whom you support.
