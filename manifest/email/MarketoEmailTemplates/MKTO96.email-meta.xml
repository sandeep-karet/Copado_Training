The impact of living with a chronic condition can be profound. And of the 60% of U.S. adults living with a chronic disease, 40% have more than one to manage—including mental health conditions. 1 Positive change is possible, however, as a recent cohort study by Teladoc Health showed that people who use our programs to manage more than one condition end up improving their overall health. It all depends on having the right tools at the right time.

In our session at the Business Group on Health’s 2022 Annual Conference, you’ll hear how SAP partnered with Teladoc Health to provide proven tools and services to help employees better manage their overall well-being. This holistic approach to health, including a comprehensive chronic condition management solution, resulted in measurable and sustainable impact on member engagement, satisfaction and health outcomes. Join us to learn more!
