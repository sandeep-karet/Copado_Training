An inside look for employers

Meet our new integrated member experience &lt;[[https://www.teladochealth.com/organizations/employers/]]&gt;

In recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month, we’re looking at the state of access, affordability and equity in mental healthcare services—and how a whole-person approach to care can accelerate progress toward better mental healthcare for all people. When mental health services are widely available, what might start as small concerns will be less likely to escalate into more profound issues later on.

Take a moment to read our recent article &lt;[[https://business.teladochealth.com/resources/infographic/5-tips-to-accelerate-mental-healthcare-access-affordability-and-equity/?&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=NWSLTR-202305-EMP-CC-NEWSLETTER-MAY&amp;utm_campaign_id=]]&gt; about the ways employers like you can accelerate mental healthcare progress this year—and beyond. For example, five times more members can access care when digital programs, coaching, therapy and psychiatry are available through a single platform.

When mental healthcare is accessible, affordable, approachable, equitable and comprehensive, it can be altogether life-changing for the people you serve.

In this issue you’ll find industry news and updates and new client and member success stories demonstrating the power of whole-person care.

Thank you for being a great partner as we continue to make better health possible for all.
