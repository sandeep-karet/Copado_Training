    <subject>Teladoc Health: Introductory Call</subject>
    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Hello}},

Our goal at Teladoc Health is to help relieve some of the common issues employers like yourself often deal with — lowering healthcare costs, improving access to care, and increasing productivity.

I wanted to reach out again after my voicemail and email to extend an invitation to book some time on my calendar to further discuss Teladoc Health. Here is the link: https://calendly.com/krisfloyd/15-minute-teladoc-chat

Again, feel free to book time for a quick introductory call to address any of your questions regarding Teladoc Health.

Regards,
Kris
