An inside look for employers

Livongo is now part of Teladoc Health, the global leader in virtual care

As we look back on the past few years, we have seen tremendous growth in the adoption and acceptance of virtual care in a variety of clinical settings. In a 2022 Teladoc Health consumer study, 6 in 10 respondents indicated either a preference for virtual or equal preference between virtual and in-person care. Employers are more focused than ever before on advancing their virtual care strategy. As we recognize Diabetes Awareness this month, it&apos;s important to think about how chronic condition management fits into that strategy.

In this issue, we share client and member success stories that illuminate the need for primary care and chronic condition management programs that work together as part of a whole-person solution.

We wish you happy holidays and New Year. We are excited to continue making better health possible in 2023.
