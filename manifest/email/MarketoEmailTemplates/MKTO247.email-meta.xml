FEATURED
As we recognize November as Diabetes Awareness Month, I’m pleased to work for Teladoc Health, an organization that is truly committed to helping those living with diabetes. In my previous position as a benefits consultant at a large consultancy, I saw firsthand how the Teladoc Health chronic condition management solutions supported employers in helping employees improve their health with personalized interventions. With 6 in 10 U.S. adults living with a chronic condition such as diabetes or hypertension,1 it’s more important than ever to offer affordable, accessible and high‑impact support that delivers real results.
My team and I are here to support you and to provide you with the resources you and your clients need to learn about our solutions. Please feel free to reach out at any time to let me know how we can assist you!
Best regards,
Lara Bunn
Vice President, Strategic Partnerships
