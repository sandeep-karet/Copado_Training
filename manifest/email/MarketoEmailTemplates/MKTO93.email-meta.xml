Virtual care has proven its ability to keep members healthy when in-person visits aren’t convenient or safe, and employers are taking notice. In the next three years, 70% of employers we surveyed expect to have fully implemented, or be close to implementing, a whole-person virtual care strategy. 1 Are you keeping pace?

Join Stephanie DeLorm, Senior Vice President of Health Solutions at Aon, and Kim Lafontana, Senior Vice President of Solutions Strategy at Teladoc Health, as they sit down to discuss redesigning care delivery that unlocks the full potential of virtual care to keep employees healthy and happy—today, tomorrow and beyond.
