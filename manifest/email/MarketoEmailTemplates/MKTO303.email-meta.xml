An inside look for employers

Meet our new integrated member experience &lt;[[https://www.teladochealth.com/organizations/employers/]]&gt;

Did you know more employers are looking for new ways to deliver primary care? Virtual care can connect more people with primary care, strengthen the relationship between member and physician, improve health outcomes and create a better member experience while reducing the cost of care.

It all starts with primary care. Today, a staggering four out of five working-age adults don’t have a strong relationship with a primary care physician. This increases their risk of undiagnosed chronic conditions, unmet mental health needs and other health concerns that stem from missed preventive care. View this infographic &lt;[[https://assets.ctfassets.net/l3v9j0ltz3yi/4akVoMOYvui76Xg9RcN3ZZ/6710a48f4a30e9b40faf57245503d494/Primary_Care_Infographic_-_Why_Now_11042021.pdf?&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=NWSLTR-202303-EMP-CC-MAR&amp;utm_campaign_id=]]&gt; to see how virtual care creates value and savings.

In this issue you’ll find news, materials and a new client success story demonstrating the power of whole-person primary care. As always, thank you for being a great partner as we continue to learn and improve our solutions in the name of better health.
