Less than 30% of U.S. stroke patients experience a door-to-needle time less than one hour 1—telestroke programs can achieve an average response time of 2 minutes and 15 seconds 2. More than just videoconferencing, Teladoc Health offers a comprehensive stroke solution—from the ambulance to the hospital and beyond—to ensure better outcomes.

Visit our booth to learn how Teladoc Health can help extend the regional presence of stroke centers to increase access to
