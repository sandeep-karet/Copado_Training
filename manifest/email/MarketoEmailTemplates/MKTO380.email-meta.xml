    <subject>Day 2 of Forum 2023 Awaits – Building on the Momentum of Day 1!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Attendee}}

And just like that, day 1 of Forum is almost over! We hope you had a wonderful first day with us and enjoyed the electrifying atmosphere, enriching sessions, and meaningful connections. Don’t forget to join us this evening at SPIN Boston, located at 30 Melcher St, Boston, MA 02210 and just a short 9-minute walk from The Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport, as we kick off the ping pong fun at 6:00pm sharp!

Day 2 kicks off tomorrow with more exciting opportunities and valuable insights. Get ready to make the most of this extraordinary event as we continue our journey together! Here are some tips to maximize your time: 


Check out the Agenda
Take a moment to delve into the event agenda &lt;[[https://forum.teladochealth.com/agenda?&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=HEVT-202307-xSEG-FRM-LIVE-EVENT&amp;utm_campaign_id=EM05/]]&gt;, allowing you to strategically plan which captivating breakout sessions to attend tomorrow morning.

Community Action: Making a Difference 
During tomorrow’s lunch hour, join us for a transformative community initiative called “Empower Packs.” Together, we will participate in a hands-on activity that will positively impact the lives of underserved children attending YMCA of Greater Boston Summer Camps. By contributing to the creation of these specially curated packs, we’ll address food insecurities they may face over the weekend. Let’s make a positive impact in the local Boston community together! 


End Forum with a Bang! 
Prepare for an awe-inspiring conclusion to Forum 2023! Our grand finale features two exceptional keynotes you won&apos;t want to miss. First, we have Marcus Samuelsson, Acclaimed chef, restaurateur and New York Times bestselling author, ready to share culinary wisdom and innovation. Following that, we have Jason Gorevic, CEO, Teladoc Health, who will impart visionary insights and game-changing strategies.
