    <textOnly>Forum The Global Community Advancing Virtual Care

Boston + Virtual
July 20-22, 2022

The agenda for Forum 2022 is filling up with global perspectives from experts and innovators shaping the future of virtual care. We’re thrilled you can join us!

Get ready to explore some of the most important topics facing our industry, including:
 
Supporting communities in their time of need
Leaders at the front lines of disaster response—as well as those responsible for their employees’ everyday needs—share how virtual care can support people in the face of unforeseen circumstances and help them achieve better health and well-being, both in the moment and over the long term.
 
Policy watch: Anticipating changes to virtual care delivery
Get a glimpse into active policy discussions—from access to care to evolving prescription policies to parity in payment and patient advocacy—with insights on how to prepare for the impact they may have on your organization.

Whole-person care for the next generation
Adolescents face many of the same health challenges that adults do—including trying to manage co-occurring mental health and chronic conditions. Yet their expectations and lifestyles differ. Explore how virtual care for both mind and body can lead to a happier, healthier future.

Forum 2022 Awards
Forum is also an opportunity for us to recognize the people who go above and beyond in their efforts to advance virtual care. Submit your nominations for deserving individuals and organizations before June 10.
