    <textOnly>Chronic conditions do not exist in silos

People with chronic conditions tend to have two or three on average. These members require an integrated solution to manage all of their chronic health needs in one place rather than across multiple uncoordinated programs.

Teladoc Health now offers Livongo Whole‑Person Solutions built to support and manage multiple chronic conditions for members while containing costs.

According to national averages:
- 56% of people living with diabetes also have hypertension 	
- 85% experience weight challenges 	
- 33% have high cholesterol 	
- 21% of people with a chronic condition also live with a mental health challenge

Data on file for diabetes, hypertension and behavioral health prevalence (DS-4266); behavioral health prevalence is based on medical claims.
