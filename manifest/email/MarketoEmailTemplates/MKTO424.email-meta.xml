    <subject>New survey reveals new directions for virtual care</subject>
    <textOnly>Build innovative, high-value benefits strategies that meet modern trends
In our new Virtual Care Transformation study, we learned that organizations are realizing the value of virtual care for its ability to address challenging market trends. In addition to leaning into virtual-first strategies, our survey of hundreds of U.S.-based employers revealed several other exciting insights about the future of virtual care, including:
- Employers are accelerating a whole-person approach to care
- Employers plan to expand their virtual mental health and chronic care services
- Equitably meeting the health needs of diverse populations is a top priority
Get all the details from the study and see the final 2023 Virtual Care Transformation Index presented at our SHRM webinar, once again featuring Kelly Bliss, U.S. Group Health President at Teladoc Health.
