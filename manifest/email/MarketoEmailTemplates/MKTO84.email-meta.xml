Making mental health a priority
Livongo is now part of Teladoc Health, the global leader in virtual care

Mental health challenges have grown dramatically since the pandemic began, paving the way for a new mental healthcare consumer—one who embraces virtual‑first and digital channels for support.

This May during Mental Health Awareness Month, we are proud to release our new, first-of-its-kind myStrength Complete program, which combines evidence‑based digital resources and virtual visits with licensed care providers to support people throughout the highs, lows, and in‑betweens of their mental health journey. A survey we released earlier this month validated our new stepped care model, finding:

- An openness to new and traditional mental health services, with participants giving nearly identical high ratings to their virtual and in-person experiences* 	
- 69% of those surveyed who sought support indicated it would be difficult and/or overwhelming to use multiple point solutions to address mental health needs* 	
- 80%+ who sought support now say they are comfortable using mental health resources through their employer, in a marked shift away from historical concerns with workplace stigma*

We look forward to your feedback on our integrated myStrength Complete program, which serves as a digital front door to the industry&apos;s first unified mental healthcare experience. And we invite you to keep reading to meet this quarter’s “Virtual Care Hero” in addition to learning insights on mental health stigma in the workplace, how mental health impacts overall business health, and how our team maximizes mental healthcare utilization.

Thanks for reading and remember, it’s okay to not be okay.
