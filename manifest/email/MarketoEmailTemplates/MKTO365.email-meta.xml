    <textOnly>Virtual care in an evolving healthcare landscape
After more than 20 years in virtual care, we’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. During our recent Virtual Partner Summit we heard from Nicola Merryman, Vice President of Commercial Strategy at Teladoc Health, on the role virtual care plays in addressing some of the most immediate challenges facing our employer clients, such as:
• A major uptick in the need for primary care
• Outcomes becoming the rule, not the exception
• More emphasis on providing high-quality, safe healthcare






• A decline in digital health point solutions
