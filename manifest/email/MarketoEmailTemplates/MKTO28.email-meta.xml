    <subject>Teladoc Health Online User Registration Process Update</subject>
    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Hello}}, 

Teladoc Health is streamlining the online registration for New Users. Our goal is to simplify the process and ensure accurate information for every new user registration. We want to be sure that you are proactively aware of these improvements. 

Outlined below are several helpful FAQs:

How is the process changing? 
You will continue to submit a new user registration through the same link (https://portal.intouchcustomer.com/UserRegistration/Create) you use today. After submitting the form, you will receive a confirmation email from our Support Team via fleetops@teladochealth.com. Previously, these confirmation emails came directly from your Client Manager. The email will include a confirmation form outlining the information submitted and will request your approval to register the user. Once this is completed, a welcome email will be sent directly to the new user.&apos;

Here are links to example emails:
• New user registration form (https://go1.teladochealth.com/rs/138-DRH-707/images/Teladoc-Health-User-Registration-Successful_Email-Sample-v2.pdf)
• Verification email (https://go1.teladochealth.com/rs/138-DRH-707/images/Teladoc-Health-User-Registration_Verification_Email-Sample-v2.pdf)

When will this new process take effect? 
This change will take effect on February 15, 2021. 

How will this affect using the bulk user registration forms? 
If you are in the midst of an active implementation, you can continue to submit your bulk user upload forms to your Technical Project Manager. If not, you can work directly with your Client Manager. 

Is my Client Manager going away? 
No. Your Client Manager will continue to work with you for all your operational and strategic needs as they do today. Our Support Team manages new user registrations on the backend, so this allows us to streamline and expedite the process. 

If you have any questions, please reach out to your Client Manager for more information. We appreciate the continued partnership and opportunity to serve you. 

Sincerely, 
Your Client Management Team
