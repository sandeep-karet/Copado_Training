An inside look for employers

Meet our new integrated member experience &lt;[[https://www.teladochealth.com/organizations/employers/]]&gt;

Care coordination is a challenge your members face every day. In fact, 64% of members living with 3+ chronic conditions say having better access to a coach would be helpful. That’s just one of the insights from our recent 7,800+ consumer study. The study’s findings underscore the importance of connecting people living with chronic conditions to primary care and mental healthcare to create the full whole-person care experience. I’d like to invite you to read the research report &lt;[[https://business.teladochealth.com/resources/report/living-with-chronic-conditions-healthcare-experiences-challenges/?&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=NWSLTR-202302-EMP-CC-NEWSLETTER-FEB&amp;utm_campaign_id=CC02/]]&gt; to learn more.

In this issue you’ll find employer materials and new client success stories that show what your peers are doing to demonstrate the power of whole-person care when managing chronic conditions.

And, as always, thank you for being a valuable partner as we continue to learn and improve our solutions in the name of better health.
