Livongo is now part of Teladoc Health, the global leader in virtual care &lt;[[http://go.teladochealth.com/livongo/]]&gt;

This year’s Forum successfully brought together leaders from all intersections of healthcare; employers, health plans, health systems and providers from around the globe to share innovations that are transforming healthcare. This world-premier virtual care event also showcased exciting updates and tangible tips to foster a community of virtual care advocates. One panel in particular explored the opportunity for employers to shift from managing a collection of health-management programs to a single, integrated solution that addresses multiple chronic conditions, including mental health. Recent data shows us that 78% of people prefer a single solution for managing their mental and physical health needs—including chronic illness.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the open enrollment materials now available in the Teladoc Health Engagement Center. By leveraging the featured assets, you will be able to highlight how our solutions provide convenient access to professional care for your population’s healthcare needs.

Read on to see the new open enrollment materials available in the Engagement Center and learn more about all the ways our chronic condition management programs help people living with these conditions lead healthier lives.

As always, thank you for being a great partner.

When it comes to diabetes, no two paths are the same because no two individuals are the same
Dr. Vidya Raman-Tangella explains how some diabetes management programs misleadingly tout their ability to “reverse” diabetes, even though major scientific organizations agree that only “remission,” not “reversal,” is possible.
