    <subject>Extending a major stroke program’s reach and efficiency through virtual care</subject>
    <textOnly>Like many hospitals and health systems, Hackensack Meridian Health struggled with physician bandwidth and burnout. Without around-the-clock access to specially trained neurologists, high-quality care and outcomes for emergent stroke patients could be compromised.
With Teladoc Health, Hackensack Meridian has kept a solid clinical team intact—including nursing and other care providers. Reducing turnover allowed Hackensack Meridian to appropriately and efficiently manage high levels of stroke acuity.
Read the full case study to learn how virtual care helped increase access to outpatient neurology care—and allows Hackensack Meridian to continue providing the highest-quality stroke care.
