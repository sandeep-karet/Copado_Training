    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Attendee}},




Forum 2023 kicks off on Tuesday, and we are thrilled for you to join us in Boston! Get ready to be part of a dynamic gathering of healthcare change makers as we dive into the transformative power of virtual care.

Explore the Forum Agenda &lt;[[https://forum.teladochealth.com/agenda?&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=HEVT-202307-xSEG-FRM-LIVE-EVENT&amp;utm_campaign_id=EM05/]]&gt; to see the impressive lineup of speakers and topics. Familiarize yourself with the schedule, so you can make the most of your experience!
Here are a few things to know before you arrive in Boston:



Hotel Reservations:
If you requested a hotel reservation, please note that you should have received your hotel confirmation directly from The Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport. If you have not yet received your hotel confirmation from the Omni, please reach out to forum@teladochealth.com &lt;[[mailto:forum@teladochealth.com]]&gt;.

Plan Your Travel:
Kindly note that the Sumner Tunnel, connecting Logan International Airport to downtown Boston, is currently closed for necessary repair work. Coming from Logan International Airport to the Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport, Forum attendees will most likely take the Ted Williams Tunnel in their route, but with the Sumner Tunnel closed, heavier traffic is expected in the Ted Williams Tunnel. Therefore, as you plan your travel, please allow for potential increased driving times to and from Logan Airport due to congestion.

Pick Up Your Badge:
Upon arriving at the Omni, make your way to the Forum registration desk (located on the second floor, next to the escalator) to check in and pick up your event badge. The desk will be open on Monday from 2:00 – 5:00 PM and on Tuesday from 7:00 – 9:00 AM.

Attire:
The dress code for Forum is business casual. Hotel ballrooms tend to fluctuate in temperature, so a jacket or light sweater is recommended. On Tuesday evening, all Forum attendees will gather for a social event at SPIN Boston and attire will be more casual.


If you have an event-related question or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact us at forum@teladochealth.com &lt;[[mailto:forum@teladochealth.com]]&gt;.

We eagerly await your arrival in Boston for what promises to be an unforgettable Forum! Wishing you safe travels and see you soon.
Compliance Action Required: CMS Open Payments Program*
We have identified you as a possible covered recipient who will receive a transfer of value related to your participation in the Teladoc Health Forum Event. Therefore, we need to provide information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for compliance purposes.
*Open Payments is a national disclosure program created by the Affordable Care Act that increases transparency into financial relationships between the health care industry (like medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies) and physicians or teaching hospitals. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) collects this data annually and makes it publicly available and searchable online at openpaymentsdata.cms.gov. Teladoc Health is considered an applicable manufacturer and therefore is required to report payments or other transfers of value we make to medical providers.
