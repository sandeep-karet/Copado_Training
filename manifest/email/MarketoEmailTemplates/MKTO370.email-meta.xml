    <textOnly>The evolution of mental healthcare delivery
It’s not just in our heads—over the past three years, Teladoc Health’s clinicians have seen a 15x jump in anxiety and depressive disorders diagnoses. During our recent Virtual Partner Summit Lori Hutchinson, Director of Solution Strategy at Teladoc Health, demoed our mental health solution and shared what employers need to support their employees amid this crisis, including:
• Accessible and easy-to-navigate services
• An integrated approach to mental and physical health (especially chronic care)
• A review of the wide range of conditions, severity levels and engagement preferences that the right mental health solution offers
