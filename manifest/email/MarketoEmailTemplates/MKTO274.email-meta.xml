Stroke-related emergencies cost the U.S. health system more than $25 billion a year. 1 As hospital leaders search for ways to alleviate this burden, many have turned to telestroke solutions for relief.

More than just videoconferencing, the Teladoc Health telestroke program offers a comprehensive solution from the ambulance to the hospital—and beyond.

If you’re attending ISC 2023, we invite you to schedule a meeting &lt;[[https://calendly.com/teladochealth-marketingevents/isc2023]]&gt; or stop by booth 1018 &lt;[[https://calendly.com/teladochealth-marketingevents/isc2023]]&gt; to hear more about how our telestroke and other high-acuity solutions expand access to specialists and improve the healthcare experience for all.
