    <textOnly>A better experience—for both our members and clients
The complexity of our members and their health are going to be addressed in a more comprehensive fashion given the broad spectrum of care Teladoc Health can provide.&quot; – Darcy Sementi, Healthcare Benefits Manager
Healthcare benefits manager Darcy Sementi already knew the positive impact Teladoc Health’s virtual care services can have on her member population. Now she’s extending the range of services she can offer her employees—including virtual primary, mental health and chronic care.
